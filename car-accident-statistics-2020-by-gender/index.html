Department of transportation’s national highway traffic safety administration released its 2020 annual traffic crash data, showing that 38,824 lives were lost. Remember, men tend to drive more miles than women, which adds to that risk. With an estimated 963 motor vehicle fatalities in 2020 (14th most in the country), new york saw its fatality rate increase 10.3% from the 873 in 2019. By comparison, almost 37,000 male drivers were involved in fatal crashes.
