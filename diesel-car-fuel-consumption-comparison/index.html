Here�s How Far You Need To Drive To Make Diesel CostEffective In America From finance.yahoo.com
According to the motley fool, in a study they conducted to compare the fuel efficiency of diesel and gas engines, diesel engines were 29 percent more efficient on the. This is because the cost of registration for the diesel car is more than that of the petrol car. Diesel engines are typically anywhere from 25% to 35% more fuel efficient than gasoline engines. Diesels are simply better in this department, as much as 30 or even 40 per.
