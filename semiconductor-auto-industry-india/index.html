COVID19 Decimates Automotive Power Semiconductor Revenue in 2020 EE From eetindia.co.in
Nina turner, research manager said, automotive semiconductors will continue to be a limiting constraint on the automotive market through the first half of 2022, but barring any. Indian auto manufacturers import electronics and related systems. By 2025, the semiconductor industry in india is expected to grow by usd 400 billion. The global automotive semiconductor market size was estimated at usd 43.6 billion in 2021.
