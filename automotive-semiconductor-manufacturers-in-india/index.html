Intel to Keep Its Number One Semiconductor Supplier Ranking in 2020 From eetindia.co.in
In the year 2021, semiconductor chip shortage is expected to cost the global automotive industry ~usd200 billion in revenue. The global $450 billion semiconductors industry got blindsided — due to the global pandemic —. When automotive demand was restored, the cascading effect resulted in acute semiconductor shortages and production disruption. Has a wide client base from across the globe.
