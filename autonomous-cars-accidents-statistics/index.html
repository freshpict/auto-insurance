<p>Autonomous vehicles, seen by many as the future of personal and public means of transport, are slowly gaining market share. In total, waymo’s vehicles were involved in 18 accidents with a pedestrian, cyclist, driver, or other object and experienced 29 disengagements — times human drivers were forced. In 37 of those cases, humans were the cause. The top three benefits they think driverless vehicles would bring are less stressful transportation (44% of respondents), increased road safety (42% of respondents), and lower.</p>
